## Introduction
[Click to visit the map ](https://jidan745le.github.io/Julia-Fractal-Map/build/)
## Instruction
The app cantains two part,one part is the julia fractal map itself.The user can make map zoom in or zoom out to visit the detailed graph by scrolling the mouse and visit the rest of the map by dragging it.

The other part is control panel.The control Panel consists of two tab.

The first tab content provide the range input for users to adjust the julia set parmeter.Different parameter generates various shape of the julia fractal graph.The second tab content displays a gradient tool.
